## Introduction

The global economy stands at a crucial juncture, facing the pressing challenges of inequality, sustainability, and the need for more inclusive economic systems. Traditional currencies, often backed by precious metals or sovereign guarantees, have facilitated trade and economic growth but also contributed to economic disparities and environmental degradation. This repository explores a revolutionary concept: using drinkable water as the foundation for a new global currency. This currency, called "Aquarius," aims to provide Universal Basic Income (UBI) for all individuals. By leveraging the scarcity and intrinsic value of drinkable water, Aquarius seeks to address both economic and environmental challenges. Water, unlike traditional commodities, is essential for life and undergoes a natural cycle of renewal, making it a unique and sustainable basis for a global currency. This proposal also aligns with the United Nations' recognition of the human right to water and sanitation, underscoring its ethical foundation.

## The Case for Water as a Currency

### Gold vs. Water: Scarcity and Intrinsic Value

Gold has been prized throughout history for several reasons. Its rarity made it a desirable and prestigious asset, often used as a standard for monetary systems and a medium of exchange. Gold's utility in jewelry, electronics, and various industrial applications also contributed to its value. Being one of the least reactive chemical elements, gold does not tarnish or corrode, preserving its appearance and value over time. This chemical stability ensures that gold remains a reliable store of value, immune to the degradation that affects many other materials.

Similarly, water preserves its value through its indispensability for life. Just as gold's chemical stability makes it valuable over time, water's essential role in sustaining human life, agriculture, and industry ensures its perpetual demand and value. Unlike gold, water's intrinsic value is universally recognized, as it is fundamental to survival and well-being.

Water is a finite resource essential for life, much like gold has been historically valuable for its rarity and utility. However, water's intrinsic value surpasses that of gold because it is vital for human survival, agriculture, and industry. While gold's value is largely based on human perception and historical precedent, water's value is grounded in its necessity for life and economic activities.

### Sustainability and the Hydrological Cycle

One significant advantage of using water as a currency is its renewable nature through the hydrological cycle. The continuous process of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation ensures a perpetual, though unevenly distributed, supply of fresh water. This cyclical nature could be harnessed to stabilize the currency's value over time, as long as sustainable management practices are implemented to ensure that water remains a replenishable resource.

### Universal Relevance and Human Rights

Unlike other commodities, drinkable water is universally relevant and essential. This universality could foster global cooperation and solidarity, as every nation and individual has a vested interest in maintaining and managing this critical resource. Furthermore, in 2010, the United Nations General Assembly explicitly recognized the human right to water and sanitation, affirming that clean drinking water and sanitation are essential to the realization of all human rights. This acknowledgment underscores the ethical dimension of water as a currency, aligning economic incentives with the fundamental human right to water.

## Mechanism of the Water-Based Currency

### Defining the Currency Unit

The new currency, which we shall call "Aquarius," could be pegged to a specific volume of drinkable water, for example, one liter. The total supply of Aquarius would correspond to the estimated global volume of accessible, drinkable water, creating a direct link between the currency and the resource it represents.

### Universal Basic Income Distribution

Under this system, every individual would receive a fixed amount of Aquarius regularly, representing a share of the global water supply. This distribution could be managed through a global institution, potentially under the auspices of the United Nations, ensuring fairness and transparency. The Universal Basic Income would provide a safety net, empowering individuals to meet their basic needs and participate in the economy.

## Implementation Challenges and Considerations

### Accurate Measurement and Distribution

One of the primary challenges is accurately measuring and monitoring the global supply of drinkable water. Advances in satellite technology and hydrological science would be crucial in providing reliable data. Additionally, establishing a fair and efficient distribution mechanism to ensure that UBI reaches every individual, particularly in remote and underdeveloped areas, would require significant logistical efforts.

### Economic Stability and Inflation Control

To maintain economic stability, the issuance of Aquarius must be carefully managed to prevent inflation. This would involve regulating the amount of currency in circulation based on changes in the global water supply and consumption patterns. Economic policies would need to account for regional variations in water availability and demand, preventing imbalances that could lead to market distortions.

### Environmental and Ethical Considerations

Linking currency to water raises significant environmental and ethical questions. It necessitates sustainable water management practices to ensure that the currency remains viable and that water resources are not depleted. Ethical considerations include ensuring equitable access to water and preventing the commodification of a basic human right. Policies would need to balance economic incentives with the imperative to preserve and protect water resources for future generations.

### Technological and Infrastructural Requirements

Implementing a water-based currency would require robust technological and infrastructural systems. Blockchain technology could provide a secure and transparent platform for managing transactions and UBI distributions, ensuring accountability and reducing the risk of fraud. Additionally, investments in water infrastructure, such as purification and distribution systems, would be essential to support the currency's viability and ensure universal access to clean water.

## Psychological Impact of a Water-Based Currency

### Valuing Essential Resources

Adopting a water-based currency could fundamentally alter the way individuals perceive and value essential resources. By directly linking economic value to drinkable water, people might develop a deeper appreciation for this critical resource, fostering a culture of conservation and sustainable use. This shift in perception could lead to more responsible behavior towards water consumption and environmental stewardship.

### Reducing Economic Anxiety

The implementation of a UBI in the form of Aquarius could significantly reduce economic anxiety. Knowing that a basic income is guaranteed and tied to a universally essential resource could provide a sense of security and stability. This assurance might reduce stress and improve mental health, allowing individuals to focus on personal development and societal contributions without the constant pressure of financial insecurity.

### Encouraging Global Solidarity

A water-based currency, underpinned by the universal necessity of water, could encourage a greater sense of global solidarity and interconnectedness. Recognizing that every person on the planet shares a vested interest in preserving and managing water resources could foster a more cooperative and compassionate global community. This shared responsibility might enhance international relations and collective action towards common goals.

### Psychological Barriers and Resistance

However, transitioning to a water-based currency could also encounter significant psychological barriers. People are accustomed to traditional forms of money and may resist change due to uncertainty and fear of the unknown. Extensive education and awareness campaigns would be necessary to address misconceptions and build public trust in the new system. Additionally, psychological resistance might stem from cultural and historical attachments to existing currencies, requiring careful and sensitive management of the transition process.

## Impact of Climate Change on a Water-Based Currency

### Current Global Droughts

Climate change has exacerbated the frequency and severity of droughts worldwide, significantly impacting the availability of drinkable water. Regions such as California in the United States, the Mediterranean, Sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of South Asia are experiencing prolonged periods of drought. These conditions are straining water resources, affecting agriculture, industry, and daily life for millions of people.

### Implications for a Water-Based Currency

The increasing prevalence of droughts due to climate change presents a critical challenge for a water-based currency. Fluctuations in water availability can lead to instability in the value of the currency. To mitigate this, a comprehensive system for tracking global water supplies and projecting future availability is essential. Investments in water infrastructure and technology to enhance water capture, storage, and distribution would also be necessary to maintain a stable supply.

### Risk of Regional Disparities

Regions already facing water scarcity could experience greater economic hardships under a water-based currency system. To address this, international cooperation and equitable distribution mechanisms must be established. Wealthier nations and regions with abundant water resources would need to support those facing shortages, ensuring that the benefits of the currency are shared globally.

### Environmental and Policy Interventions

Addressing the environmental impacts of climate change is crucial to the success of a water-based currency. Policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting watersheds, and promoting sustainable water use are vital. Additionally, advancements in water recycling and desalination technologies could help augment freshwater supplies, stabilizing the currency's value.

## Comparison with Communist Perspectives

### Similarities

1. **Universal Basic Income:** Both the water-based currency system and communist perspectives advocate for providing basic needs to all individuals. In communism, this is achieved through state-controlled distribution of resources, while the water-based currency proposes a UBI linked to an essential resource.

2. **Resource Allocation:** Communism emphasizes equitable distribution of resources, aiming to eliminate economic disparities. The water-based currency system also seeks to ensure fair access to a vital resource, potentially reducing inequality.

3. **Collective Good:** Both systems prioritize the collective good over individual profit. In communism, this is manifested through collective ownership and control of production. Similarly, the water-based currency system emphasizes the shared responsibility of managing a critical resource for the benefit of all.

### Differences

1. **Economic Structure:** Communism advocates for the abolition of private property and the establishment of a classless society through collective ownership. The water-based currency system, while promoting equitable resource distribution, operates within a capitalist framework, allowing for private enterprise and market dynamics.

2. **Incentives and Innovation:** Capitalism, which underpins the water-based currency system, relies on market incentives to drive innovation and efficiency. In contrast, communism often faces challenges in fostering innovation due to the lack of individual profit motives.

3. **Governance and Control:** In communism, the state plays a central role in planning and controlling the economy. The water-based currency system, however, proposes a decentralized approach, potentially using blockchain technology for transparent and efficient management.

4. **Flexibility and Adaptation:** The water-based currency system can adapt to market conditions and technological advancements, fostering a dynamic and responsive economy. Communism, with its centralized planning, may struggle to adapt quickly to changing circumstances.

## Preserving a Capitalist Approach

### Market Mechanisms and Incentives

To preserve the capitalist approach while implementing a water-based currency, it is essential to integrate market mechanisms and incentives. Businesses and individuals can still engage in profit-driven activities, fostering innovation and economic growth. The water-based currency can coexist with traditional currencies, allowing for diverse economic interactions.

### Supporting Private Enterprise

Private enterprise remains a cornerstone of the capitalist system. The water-based currency should support and incentivize private businesses to invest in sustainable water management practices. This can be achieved through subsidies, tax incentives, and public-private partnerships that promote innovation and efficiency in water use.

### Encouraging Competition

Competition drives efficiency and innovation in a capitalist economy. The water-based currency system can encourage competition among businesses to develop new technologies and solutions for water conservation and management. This competitive environment can lead to better products, services, and practices that benefit society as a whole.

### Regulatory Framework

A robust regulatory framework is necessary to ensure that the water-based currency system operates effectively within a capitalist economy. Regulations should promote transparency, prevent exploitation, and ensure that water resources are managed sustainably. This framework can balance the need for economic growth with the imperative to protect and preserve essential resources.

### Education and Public Awareness

To garner public support and ensure successful implementation, extensive education and public awareness campaigns are crucial. These initiatives should highlight the benefits of the water-based currency, address misconceptions, and build trust in the new system. Educating individuals and businesses about sustainable water practices and the importance of conservation can foster a culture of responsibility and stewardship.

## Hypotheses for Further Investigation

1. **Social and Ethical Implications (Economic impact on different regions):** Investigate how a water-based currency would affect economies with varying levels of water resources. How would it address issues of water rights and access, particularly for marginalized communities? Would it lead to greater economic parity, or could it exacerbate existing inequalities?

2. **Behavioral Changes in Water Consumption (Environmental outcomes):** Explore whether linking currency to water would incentivize more sustainable water use practices among individuals and industries. Would it drive better water management and conservation efforts, leading to improved ecosystem health? Could it lead to a cultural shift towards valuing and conserving water?

3. **Technological Feasibility:** Evaluate the technological requirements and feasibility of implementing a global water-based currency system. What advancements in monitoring, data collection, and transaction security are needed?

4. **Long-term Sustainability:** Consider the long-term sustainability of a water-based currency in the face of climate change and population growth. How can the system adapt to changing water availability and ensure continued stability?

5. **Psychological Adaptation:** Research how individuals and societies adapt psychologically to a water-based currency. What are the long-term effects on values, behaviors, and mental health?

## Conclusion

The concept of a water-based global currency, Aquarius, represents a bold and innovative approach to addressing economic inequality, environmental sustainability, and the fundamental human right to water. While the implementation of such a system poses significant challenges, it also offers a unique opportunity to align economic incentives with the stewardship of a critical resource. By exploring the feasibility and implications of Aquarius, we can move towards a more equitable and sustainable global economy. The United Nations' recognition of the human right to water and sanitation provides a strong ethical foundation for this endeavor, emphasizing the importance of ensuring access to this essential resource for all people. Furthermore, the psychological impacts of such a currency could foster a culture of sustainability, reduce economic anxiety, and promote global solidarity, contributing to a healthier and more cooperative world.

However, the implementation of this system poses significant challenges, particularly in the face of climate change and its impact on water availability. Addressing these challenges requires careful planning, technological innovation, and robust international cooperation.

This balance ensures that the system can drive innovation and efficiency while promoting global well-being.

In conclusion, the Aquarius currency offers a visionary path towards a more sustainable and inclusive economic model, grounded in the intrinsic value of water. By fostering responsible water management and ensuring fair distribution, this system can help create a healthier, more cooperative, and economically stable world. Through thoughtful implementation and global collaboration, the Aquarius currency has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach both economics and environmental stewardship.

## Acknowledgement

The name and sentiment of desire for an essential intrinsically valued currency, taking into considerations the global challenges, were inspired by the Academy award winning movie 'The Shape of Water'. I can clearly relate the current hardship inequalities being faced by the majority of the population, while trying to break free from the confined expirience of the XXI'st century lifestyle. I was also inspired from the disparities prospective currencies, such as 'Bitcoin', were unable achieve falling back to the traps of a self-centered and infinite exponential growth, delusion Capitalism may pose. Furthermore, I was also inspired by the attempts of solidarity established by the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI), which in my perspective undermine the fact that they lack a solid foundation of the concept of "value" to which they are based upon "precious" metals or sovereign "guarantees". Last but not least, with the recent climate change based drought advancements, it is imperative to take conscience and action for the preservation of "life" as we know it.
